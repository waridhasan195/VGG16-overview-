# VGG16-overview-

VGG16 performed well for our dataset and give 87% validation accuracy. In Fig: 4.4.2.1 we see that a little difference between training accuracy and validation accuracy. In training time it makes low noise and smoother. Fig: 4.4.2.2 shows the training loss of VGG16 it going to the lower loss.
